# MineDraft

A utility to shape terrains using 2D text files.

# Improvement

* (Workflow) A seperate dedicated C# .Net Core program can be written that can convert any 2D color image into such a MineDraft description file, with automatic pixelation of color blocks - for instance by limiting each R/G/B channel to only 4 levels, and select a total of 64 preset block types.
